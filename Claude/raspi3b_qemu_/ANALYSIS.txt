Here's the diffs between the asm runs:

Looking at the assembly differences between the two runs, I can see some significant divergence in code paths. Let me analyze what I'm seeing:
Key Differences in Execution Paths

    Key Derivation Function (KDF) Execution
        There are differences in the derive_key function execution paths
        In the "bad" case, there appears to be a different branch taken during key derivation
    Block Filter Differences
        The "good" run shows extensive execution through block_filter function (multiple instruction blocks)
        These block filter operations are completely missing in the "bad" run
    Parse Function Differences
        The "good" run has extensive execution through parse.constprop.0 function with many branches and memory operations
        The "bad" run takes a much shorter path through this function, jumping to 0x105bc instead of executing the detailed parsing
    Different Memory Handling
        The "good" run has multiple memory load/store operations and buffer handling
        The "bad" run appears to bail out early from several functions

Root Cause Analysis

The most significant pattern I'm seeing is that the second test with the longer passphrase is triggering an early exit condition in the parsing code. Here's what I believe is happening:

    The longer passphrase (64 characters) is likely exceeding a buffer size or expected length in the KDF
    When the KDF attempts to derive a key from this long passphrase, it's either:
        Taking a different code path designed for longer passphrases
        Encountering a validation check that fails
        Causing memory corruption that affects later execution
    The parse function in the second case is taking a completely different branch - in particular, I notice this sequence in the "bad" run:

    0x000103ec:  ea000072      b	0x105bc
    0x000105bc:  e3a00000      mov	r0, #0	; 0x0
    0x000105c0:  e1a01006      mov	r1, r6
    0x000105c4:  ebffeffd      bl	0xc5c0

    This shows it's immediately jumping to an error handling path instead of processing the data.
    The most telling sign is the complete absence of the block filtering code in the second run, which suggests the decryption process isn't even getting to the point of processing the encrypted data blocks.

Likely Scenarios

    Buffer Size Issue: The KDF may have a fixed-size buffer for the passphrase that's being exceeded by the 64-character passphrase in Test 2.
    Memory Corruption: The longer passphrase might be causing a buffer overflow in the KDF, corrupting adjacent memory which affects later execution.
    Early Validation Failure: There might be a validity check early in the KDF or decrypt process that's failing with the longer passphrase.
    Different Algorithm Path: The implementation might have different code paths for different passphrase lengths, and the longer one is triggering a path with a bug.

Recommendations

Based on this analysis, I recommend:

    Check if there are any hard-coded buffer size limits in the KDF function that might be exceeded by the 64-character passphrase.
    Add instrumentation before and after the KDF to check if the session key is being generated correctly.
    Look for any length validation checks in the decrypt_memory function that might be rejecting the longer passphrase.
    Try an intermediate-length passphrase (e.g., 32 characters) to see if that works or fails, which might help isolate if it's exactly at a buffer boundary.
    Check for any conditional branches in the KDF that depend on passphrase length or characteristics.

The core issue appears to be in how the longer passphrase is processed, causing the program to take an early exit path rather than proceeding with normal decryption.

Could you help produce a bash script which takes arguments to be able to overwrite testNumber.h before running a make command?

I'll create a bash script that overwrites testNumber.h with a custom test number before running make. This will allow you to easily switch between different test cases without manually editing the file each time.

The script I've created (run_test.sh) gives you a flexible way to run your tests with different test numbers. Here's how to use it:

    First, make the script executable:

    bash

chmod +x run_test.sh

Basic usage examples:

    Run test number 1 (default):

    bash

./run_test.sh --run

Run test number 2:

bash

./run_test.sh -t 2 -r

Debug test number 1:

bash

./run_test.sh -t 1 -d

Use a custom kernel image:

bash

./run_test.sh -t 2 -k kernel.bad.img -r

Clean, build, and run with logging:

bash

        ./run_test.sh -c -t 2 -l

The script:

    Takes command-line options to control test number, build targets, and run modes
    Backs up your original testNumber.h
    Creates a new testNumber.h with your specified test number
    Runs the build with your specified options
    Executes the binary if requested (with run, debug, or log options)
    Restores your original testNumber.h file when done

This way you can easily switch between different test cases without having to manually edit files between runs.
FH

Can we simplify this script to simple clean and make the kernel with the test number?

I'll simplify the script to focus on just cleaning, setting the test number, and building the kernel.

I've simplified the script significantly. Now it:

    Takes only two optional parameters:
        -t or --test to set the test number (defaults to 1)
        -r or --run to run the kernel after building
    Performs these steps in order:
        Cleans the previous build using make clean
        Sets the test number in testNumber.h
        Builds the kernel with make
        Optionally runs the kernel with make run if the -r flag is provided

Usage examples:

bash

# Build with test number 1 (default)
./run_test.sh

# Build with test number 2
./run_test.sh -t 2

# Build with test number 1 and run
./run_test.sh -r

# Build with test number 2 and run
./run_test.sh -t 2 -r

This simplified version focuses on the core functionality of setting the test number, cleaning, and building, which should make it easier to use.
FH

Could we somehow make the Makefile append the testnumber to the TARGET e.g. kernel1.img or kernel2.img?

That's a great idea! We can modify both the script and add a parameter to the Makefile to include the test number in the output filename. Here's how we can implement this:

I've updated the script and created a snippet for modifying your Makefile to support numbered kernel output files. Here's how it works:
1. Script Changes

The script now passes the test number to the Makefile using make TEST_NUM=$TEST_NUMBER. This tells the Makefile to use this number when naming the output file.
2. Makefile Modifications

Add these lines to your Makefile:

makefile

# Add TEST_NUM parameter (defaults to empty)
TEST_NUM ?= 

# Modify the TARGET line to include the test number if provided
ifeq ($(TEST_NUM),)
TARGET = $(BUILD_DIR)/kernel.img
else
TARGET = $(BUILD_DIR)/kernel$(TEST_NUM).img
endif

# Update the KERNEL line to match the new TARGET
KERNEL ?= $(TARGET)

This modification:

    Adds a TEST_NUM variable that gets passed from the script
    Conditionally modifies the TARGET filename to include the test number
    Updates the KERNEL variable to use the new target name

Implementation Steps

    First, update your Makefile with the provided modifications. Make sure to place them in the appropriate locations:
        The TEST_NUM ?= line near your other variable definitions
        The TARGET conditional block replacing your current TARGET definition
        Update the KERNEL line if needed
    Then, use the updated script to build and run your tests:

    bash

    ./run_test.sh -t 2

    This will create build/kernel2.img instead of just build/kernel.img
    When running with the -r flag, it will automatically use the correct numbered kernel image.

This approach gives you distinct kernel images for each test number, making it easier to compare results between different test runs.
FH

Could we add the Makefile log function to this file:
#!/bin/bash
# Default values
TEST_NUMBER=1
RUN_AFTER_BUILD=false
# Help text
function show_help {
echo "Usage: $0 [OPTIONS]"
echo "Options:"
echo " -t, --test NUM Set test number (default: 1)"
echo " -r, --run Run after building"
echo " -h, --help Show this help message"
echo ""
echo "Examples:"
echo " $0 -t 2 # Build with test number 2"
echo " $0 -t 1 -r # Build and run with test number 1"
}
# Parse command line arguments
while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; do
case $1 in
-t|--test)
TEST_NUMBER="$2"
shift 2
 ;;
-r|--run)
RUN_AFTER_BUILD=true
shift
 ;;
-h|--help)
show_help
exit 0
 ;;
*)
echo "Unknown option: $1"
show_help
exit 1
 ;;
esac
done
# Check if src/testNumber.h exists
if [ ! -f "src/testNumber.h" ]; then
echo "Error: src/testNumber.h not found in current directory."
exit 1
fi
# Clean the build
echo "Cleaning previous build..."
make clean
# Generate new src/testNumber.h with specified test number
echo "Setting test number to $TEST_NUMBER..."
echo "int testNumber = $TEST_NUMBER;" > src/testNumber.h
# Build the project with the test number in the output filename
echo "Building kernel with test number $TEST_NUMBER..."
make TEST_NUM=$TEST_NUMBER
# Check if build was successful
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
echo "Build failed!"
exit 1
else
echo "Build successful! Output: $(ls build/kernel$TEST_NUMBER.img 2>/dev/null || echo 'build/kernel.img')"
fi
# Run if requested
if [ "$RUN_AFTER_BUILD" = true ]; then
echo "Running kernel..."
make run TEST_NUM=$TEST_NUMBER
fi
echo "Done."

I'll add the log functionality from your Makefile to the script. This will give you a way to create logs with the test number included in the filename.

I've added logging support to your script. Here's what I've changed:

    Added a new command-line option:
        -l or --log to enable logging (similar to the log target in your Makefile)
    Added a new variable LOG_ENABLED to track whether logging was requested
    Modified the execution logic so that:
        If logging is enabled, it runs make log TEST_NUM=$TEST_NUMBER instead of the regular run
        If logging is not enabled but running is, it runs as before with make run TEST_NUM=$TEST_NUMBER
        If neither is requested, it just builds the kernel

To use this updated script:

bash

# Build with test number 2 and run with logging
./run_test.sh -t 2 -l

# This will:
# 1. Clean the previous build
# 2. Set test number to 2 in src/testNumber.h
# 3. Build kernel2.img
# 4. Run with logging enabled, using the log target in your Makefile

This script should now work with your existing Makefile's log target, passing along the test number so that your logs can be named accordingly (e.g., qemu.in_asm.test2.log).
FH

How can I fix this log:
log: $(TARGET)
 $(QEMU) -M versatilepb -cpu cortex-a7 -kernel $(TARGET) -d int,guest_errors,mmu,in_asm -D results/$(TARGET).in_asm.log -nographic -serial mon:stdio

replacing build with results:
results/build/kernel1.img.in_asm.log: No such file or directory

Let's fix the log target in your Makefile to correctly handle the file paths and directory structure.

The problem is that your log target is trying to use the full path of $(TARGET) (which is build/kernel1.img) in the output log filename, but it's prepending results/ to that path, resulting in results/build/kernel1.img.in_asm.log, which doesn't exist.

Here's how to fix the log target in your Makefile:

    Replace your current log target with this fixed version:

makefile

log: $(TARGET)
	@mkdir -p results
	$(QEMU) -M versatilepb -cpu cortex-a7 -kernel $(TARGET) -d int,guest_errors,mmu,in_asm -D results/kernel$(TEST_NUM).in_asm.log -nographic -serial mon:stdio

This updated version:

    Creates the results directory if it doesn't exist
    Uses just kernel$(TEST_NUM).in_asm.log as the filename (without the build/ directory in it)
    Places the log file in the results/ directory with a clean filename

With this change, running:

bash

./run_test.sh -t 1 -l

Will generate a log file at:

results/kernel1.in_asm.log

And similarly, running:

bash

./run_test.sh -t 2 -l

Will generate:

results/kernel2.in_asm.log

This makes your log files easier to find and name consistently regardless of where your kernel images are stored.
FH

Here is kernel1.img.in_asm.log:
Could I somehow reduce the output or do I need it all to compare to test 2?

I'll help you create a script to analyze the differences between test runs. Looking at the disassembly log, it contains a lot of detailed execution tracing that would be overwhelming to review manually.

I've created a script to help analyze the differences between your test runs. The script will extract and compare the crypto-related functions from your execution logs, making it easier to identify differences between test cases.
How to use the script:

    First, make it executable:

    bash

chmod +x compare_tests.sh

Run both test cases to generate the logs:

bash

./run_test.sh -t 1 -l
./run_test.sh -t 2 -l

Compare the logs:

bash

    ./compare_tests.sh -1 results/kernel1.in_asm.log -2 results/kernel2.in_asm.log

The script will generate three output files in the analysis directory:

    summary.txt: A concise overview of the differences
    crypto_params.txt: Extracted crypto parameters from both logs
    diff_analysis.txt: Detailed differences between the execution traces

What the script does:

    Extracts execution traces for crypto-related functions:
        decrypt_memory
        SHA1 functions
        derive_key
        proc_encryption
        passphrase_to_dek
    Formats these traces to make them more readable
    Compares the traces between the two logs
    Extracts key parameters like passphrases and keys from the logs

This approach should help you quickly identify if the issue is related to:

    Different paths in the crypto execution flow
    Different parameters being passed to crypto functions
    Different return values from crypto operations

Let me know if you need further assistance analyzing the results!
FH

It will always be -1 results/kernel1.in_asm.log -2 results/kernel2.in_asm.log so simplify the script

I'll simplify the script to assume the log files are always results/kernel1.in_asm.log and results/kernel2.in_asm.log.

I've simplified the script as requested. Now it:

    Always uses the fixed log file paths:
        results/kernel1.in_asm.log
        results/kernel2.in_asm.log
    The only options now are:
        -f or --filter to change the filter mode (crypto, decrypt, or all)
        -o or --output to change the output directory
        -h or --help to show the help message
    I've also added a new output file called key_context.txt which extracts 5 lines before and after any password or key-related strings to provide more context about how they're being used.

To use the script:

bash

chmod +x compare_tests.sh
./compare_tests.sh

That's it! The script will automatically analyze the two log files from your test runs, with sensible defaults, and put the results in the analysis directory.
FH

./compareTests.sh

Crypto Parameters: analysis/crypto_params.txt
Key Context: analysis/key_context.txt
Detailed diff: analysis/diff_analysis.txt

It looks like there's an issue with the awk command syntax on your system. Let me fix the script with a more compatible version:

I've updated the script to fix the syntax error with the awk command. Instead of using complex awk processing, I've simplified the approach while adding more useful analysis:

    Removed the problematic awk code that was causing errors on your system
    Added function call frequency comparison between the two test runs
    Added a new "crypto_lines.txt" output that captures all crypto-related lines
    Enhanced the summary to include function call counts for each test

The script now produces these output files:

    summary.txt: Overview with differences and function call counts
    function_frequency.txt: Side-by-side comparison of function call frequencies
    crypto_parameters.txt: Extracted crypto parameters from both logs
    crypto_lines.txt: All lines related to crypto operations
    key_context.txt: Context around password and key references
    diff_analysis.txt: Full diff of the extracted traces

Try running the updated script:

bash

chmod +x compareTests.sh
./compareTests.sh

This should work without any syntax errors, and the analysis will help you pinpoint differences between your test cases, particularly around how the crypto functions behave with the different test parameters.
FH

      1 SHA1Init                              1 SHA1Init

It looks like both test cases have the exact same function call frequency. This is an interesting finding, as it suggests that both tests follow the same execution path at a high level.

Since the function call counts are identical, let's dig deeper into what might be causing the issue. There are a few possibilities:

    Data differences: The same functions are called, but with different parameters (like the different password values)
    Internal state differences: The functions might behave differently based on internal state or memory conditions
    Return value processing: The functions might return different values that affect later behavior

Let's examine the crypto parameters and key context files. Does the crypto_parameters.txt or key_context.txt show any significant differences between the test runs?

Also, could you check the first few kilobytes of each log file directly? It might help to see how the execution flows differ at the start:

bash

head -n 50 results/kernel1.in_asm.log
head -n 50 results/kernel2.in_asm.log

Looking at the main.c code from your first message, I can see that you have two different test cases:

    Test 1: Using test_passphrase = "password"; (described as "Good PW")
    Test 2: Using test_passphrase = "2af14ef19220d275b0f87907f4ab5075dc9b75b574ef8c2e06e32e8311776945"; (longer hash-like string)

The code comments also mention:

// const char *key = "693B7847FA44CDC6E1C403F5E44E95C1"; // Test 1. Good Derived Key
// const char *key = "427c028e28eeb15464c376d7dcca6ca2"; // Test 2. Good/Bad Derived Key???

But in both tests, you set ctrl->session_key = NULL; // Force KDF which means it's forcing key derivation from the passphrase.

This suggests that the difference is likely in how the passphrases are being processed and used in the decryption operation. The different files being decrypted in each test could also be a factor:

    Test 1: decrypt_memory(ctrl, encrypted_1k_gpg, encrypted_1k_gpg_len);
    Test 2: decrypt_memory(ctrl, __7379ab5047b143c0b6cfe5d8d79ad240b4b4f8cced55aa26f86d1d3d370c0d4c_gpg, __7379ab5047b143c0b6cfe5d8d79ad240b4b4f8cced55aa26f86d1d3d370c0d4c_gpg_len);

Let's focus on those specific parts of the execution to find the differences.

Interesting finding! The main difference I see is just a slight reordering of when the derive_key function is called in the execution sequence, but the total count remains the same.

Let's take a closer look at what's happening. In both tests:

    The crypto functions are called exactly the same number of times
    The general execution path is nearly identical
    The only difference is a slight reordering of when one derive_key call happens

This suggests that the actual crypto operations are proceeding in almost exactly the same way in both test cases, despite using different passwords and encrypted data.

Since we're seeing that same function counts but a failure in Test 2, the issue is likely in either:

    The specific password value in Test 2 is invalid for the encrypted data it's trying to decrypt
    The encrypted data in Test 2 is corrupted or has a different format than expected
    There's a subtle memory issue happening that isn't visible in the function call trace

Given that your code commented Test 2 as "BAD DECRYPT", this seems to be expected behavior. The comment in your main.c suggests that the second test case has a known issue:

c

// Test 2. Good/Bad Derived Key???

The question marks indicate uncertainty, and then later there's a comment:

c

else rc = decrypt_memory(ctrl, __7379ab5047b143c0b6cfe5d8d79ad240b4b4f8cced55aa26f86d1d3d370c0d4c_gpg, __7379ab5047b143c0b6cfe5d8d79ad240b4b4f8cced55aa26f86d1d3d370c0d4c_gpg_len); // Test 2. BAD DECRYPT !!!!

The execution traces suggest that the crypto code is working as designed in both cases, but Test 2 is simply failing to decrypt properly with the given passphrase/key.

To debug this further, you might want to:

    Check if the return code (rc) is different between Test 1 and Test 2
    Add more detailed logging inside the decrypt_memory function to see the actual decryption results or error conditions
    Verify the passphrase value for Test 2 is correct for the encrypted data

Would you like me to help you modify the code to add more detailed logging around the decryption process?

I'll help you add a command to diff the dump files. Here's how to modify the script:

I've created an enhanced version of your script that adds comprehensive diff functionality. Here's what the updated script does:

    Adds a new -d or --diff option to create diff files between the current test and the other test build
    Creates three different types of diff files:
        Full disassembly diff between the two kernels
        Focused diff of just the decrypt_memory function
        Diff of the function lists to easily spot missing or added functions
    Automatically generates a summary report (build_comparison.txt) that shows:
        Binary size comparison between Test 1 and Test 2
        Function count comparison
        Size of the decrypt_memory function in each build
        References to the diff files for more detailed analysis
    Creates the results directory if it doesn't exist

To use this updated script:

    Build Test 1:

    bash

./run_test.sh -t 1

Build Test 2 and generate diffs:

bash

./run_test.sh -t 2 -d

Check the results:

bash

    cat results/build_comparison.txt

This will help you identify if there are any code differences between the two builds that might explain why Test 2 is failing. Since both builds are from the same source code with just a different testNumber.h value, you shouldn't see any significant differences in the disassembly unless there's conditional compilation or other preprocessor directives that depend on the test number.

If the disassembly is identical but the behaviors differ, then it's likely a runtime issue with the different passphrase or encrypted data being used in Test 2.

Add a basic cmp and add a diff between the in_asm files too:

kernel1.img kernel2.img differ: byte 99625, line 806

I'll update the script to include a basic cmp check and a diff between the in_asm log files.

I've updated the script to include:

    Binary comparison with cmp:
        Now performs a basic cmp comparison between the kernel images
        Stores the output in results/kernel_binary_cmp.txt
        Shows the first 5 differences in the summary file
    Execution log comparison:
        Creates a diff between the in_asm.log files
        Stores the result in results/in_asm_logs.diff
    Crypto-focused log comparison:
        Extracts crypto-related lines from both logs
        Compares them and stores the diff in results/crypto_lines.diff

The updated script will help you pinpoint the exact differences between the two builds and their execution. Since you've discovered that the binary files differ at byte 99625 (line 806), this specific area is worth investigating further. The cmp result in the summary will provide this information as well.

Based on your cmp output showing the files differ at byte 99625, there's definitely a binary difference between the two images, despite them being built from the same source code with just a different test number. This suggests one of a few possibilities:

    The test number is embedded directly in the binary
    There's conditional compilation depending on the test number
    The compiler might be optimizing differently due to constants derived from the test number

With the enhanced script and additional diffs, you should be able to identify exactly what's causing the difference in behavior between the two tests.

Looking at the in_asm_logs.diff output, I can see several interesting differences between the execution of test 1 and test 2:

    Different code paths in the main function:
        Test 1 takes a jump at address 0x0001384c and 0x00013868
        Test 2 follows a more direct path (lines 131-137 and 541-547)
    Different behavior in tfp_format:
        Test 1 has a simpler path at 0x000120f8
        Test 2 has a more complex execution with additional math operations, including division (udiv) at 0x00011f74
    Reordering of instructions in derive_key:
        The same code blocks appear in both logs but in a different order (lines 2704 and 3981)
    Different math operations:
        Test 2 has additional division operations (udiv) and multiplication operations that don't appear in Test 1

These differences suggest that even though the function call counts are identical, the actual execution path differs between the two tests. The most significant difference appears to be in the mathematical operations, particularly in the tfp_format function.

Given that the test is about decryption and passphrase handling, the difference in mathematical operations suggests that the key derivation or cipher operations are processing different data, resulting in different computation paths.

The reordering of execution in the derive_key function is particularly interesting, as this is directly related to password handling. This could indicate that the algorithm is handling the different passphrase values in different ways.

Since you've confirmed with cmp that the binaries differ at byte 99625, it's clear that the different test number is causing different compiled code, not just different data values. This could be due to conditional compilation or compiler optimizations based on the different constants defined in each test.

To fix the issue with test 2, you might need to:

    Look more closely at the passphrase value in test 2 to make sure it's in the correct format
    Check if the encryption method expecting this particular passphrase has any special requirements
    Verify that the encrypted data file for test 2 is compatible with the passphrase being used

The most likely issue is that the passphrase format in test 2 doesn't match what the encryption algorithm is expecting, causing a decryption failure despite following the same general sequence of function calls.

Could you provide a script that makes a backup of kernel2.img then patches it so that these discrepancies don't occur?

I can create a script that makes a backup of kernel2.img and patches it to match kernel1.img at the differences shown. This approach is a bit advanced since we're directly patching binary files, but it should help resolve the discrepancies identified in the disassembly.

I've created a script to patch kernel2.img based on the differences identified in the execution logs. This is a somewhat experimental approach, as binary patching can be tricky, but it addresses the key discrepancies we've found.

The script:

    Creates a timestamped backup of the original kernel2.img
    Patches several key areas where the execution differs:
        The branch instructions in the main function
        The tfp_format function code path
        Additional instructions in the number formatting code
        (Note: The script mentions but doesn't attempt to fix the instruction reordering in derive_key)
    Calculates checksums to verify if the patch worked
    Saves the patched version as kernel2.img.patched

To use this script:

bash

chmod +x patch_kernel2.sh
./patch_kernel2.sh

After running, you can test the patched kernel with:

bash

make run KERNEL=results/kernel2.img.patched

Important Notes:

    This approach is experimental and may not completely fix the issue. Binary patching is complex, especially when dealing with:
        PC-relative addressing that might need adjustment
        Jump offsets that may need recalculation
        Memory location constants embedded in the code
    A more reliable approach would be to:
        Analyze the source code to understand why test 2 is failing
        Look particularly at the passphrase handling for the second test
        Check if the input data or format expectations for test 2 match what's being provided
    If the passphrase format is the issue, you might try modifying src/testNumber.h to change the format of the passphrase in test 2, rather than patching the binary.

Let me know how the patched binary works, and I can help refine the approach if needed!

To use the patched kernel, run:
  make run KERNEL=results/kernel2.img.patched

But it actually just runs kernel.img, can you help fix the Makefile maybe add a runPatch?

I'll help you add a runpatch target to your Makefile to run the patched kernel. Here's what we need to add:

You'll need to add these new targets to your Makefile. The problem is that when you run make run KERNEL=results/kernel2.img.patched, the Makefile is using the KERNEL variable but possibly not in the right way.

Here's what to do:

    Open your Makefile
    Add the three new targets from the code I provided above
    Save the file

Then you can run the patched kernel using:

bash

make runpatch

Or with logging:

bash

make logpatch

These new targets explicitly specify the patched kernel path as results/kernel2.img.patched rather than relying on the KERNEL variable, which may not be working correctly in your current setup.

If you still want to fix the original run target to properly use the KERNEL variable, you'd need to check how that target is defined in your Makefile. The issue might be that the variable is being set differently depending on whether it's provided on the command line or not.

And provide context for there appearance

I'll walk through each of these differences in the disassembly logs and explain their context:
Difference 1: Address change in main function setup (lines 131-137)

Test 1:

assembly

0x00013844: e59f4064 ldr r4, [pc, #100]  ; 0x138b0
0x00013848: e08f4004 add r4, pc, r4
0x0001384c: eaffffcd b 0x13788

Test 2:

assembly

0x00013780: e59f4110 ldr r4, [pc, #272]  ; 0x13898
0x00013784: e08f4004 add r4, pc, r4

Context: This is in the main function early in execution. In both tests, the code is loading a pointer into register r4 from a PC-relative address, but the addresses and offsets differ. In Test 1, after loading the pointer, it explicitly branches to address 0x13788, while in Test 2, execution just falls through to that address without a branch instruction.

This suggests that your code was compiled slightly differently between the two tests, resulting in different code layout. The value being loaded is likely a pointer to the passphrase or the test parameters.
Difference 2: Address change before decrypt_memory (lines 541-547)

Test 1:

assembly

0x00013860: e59f2050 ldr r2, [pc, #80]  ; 0x138b8
0x00013864: e59f3050 ldr r3, [pc, #80]  ; 0x138bc
0x00013868: eaffffe1 b 0x137f4

Test 2:

assembly

0x000137ec: e59f20ac ldr r2, [pc, #172] ; 0x138a0
0x000137f0: e59f30ac ldr r3, [pc, #172] ; 0x138a4

Context: This is right before calling the decrypt_memory function. Again, both tests are loading values from PC-relative addresses, but with different offsets. In Test 1, there's an explicit branch instruction afterward, while Test 2 just falls through.

This section is likely loading pointers to the encrypted data and the size parameters just before the decrypt_memory call. The different offsets reflect different placement of these values in memory between the two builds.
Difference 3: Different algorithm in tfp_format (lines 2307-2316)

Test 1:

assembly

0x000120f8: e1a0200e mov r2, lr
0x000120fc: eaffffa1 b 0x11f88

Test 2:

assembly

0x00011f6c: e3a0100a mov r1, #10       ; 0xa
0x00011f70: e0030391 mul r3, r1, r3
0x00011f74: e732f31e udiv r2, lr, r3
0x00011f78: e3520009 cmp r2, #9        ; 0x9
0x00011f7c: 8afffffb bhi 0x11f70
0x00011f80: e3530000 cmp r3, #0        ; 0x0
0x00011f84: 0a00005d beq 0x12100

Context: This is in the tfp_format function, which handles formatting numbers for display or logging. Test 1 uses a simple move instruction and a branch, while Test 2 uses a more complex algorithm with multiplication, division, and conditional branches.

This likely relates to how the different passphrases are being processed or formatted. In Test 1, with the shorter "password" value, the formatting is simpler. In Test 2, with the longer hash-like passphrase, more complex formatting code is being used, possibly to handle the longer value in chunks.
Difference 4: Additional division operations (lines 2352-2376)

Test 2 only:

assembly

0x00011fac: e73cf11e udiv ip, lr, r1
0x00011fb0: e1a03001 mov r3, r1
[...more complex math operations...]
0x00011fe8: 1affffeb bne 0x11f9c

Context: Test 2 has additional math operations, particularly unsigned division (udiv) operations that don't appear in Test 1. This is a continuation of the formatting differences above.

The longer, more complex passphrase in Test 2 is likely requiring more mathematical processing for proper handling. These operations might be for converting the hexadecimal characters to binary values or for computing a derived key from the passphrase.
Difference 5: Reordering in derive_key (lines 2704-2710 and 3981-3987)

Test 1:

assembly

0x0000f0a0: e1570005 cmp r7, r5
0x0000f0a4: e3a03000 mov r3, #0        ; 0x0
0x0000f0a8: e3a04001 mov r4, #1        ; 0x1
0x0000f0ac: 9a000003 bls 0xf0c0

Test 2: Same code appears later in the execution

Context: This block of code from the derive_key function appears in both tests but at different points in the execution trace. The instructions themselves are identical, but the ordering within the execution flow is different.

This suggests that while both tests are calling the same functions, the execution path within those functions differs slightly based on the different passphrase values. This reordering is particularly important since derive_key is directly responsible for converting the passphrase into the encryption key.
Overall Analysis

These differences show that even though both tests call the same functions in the same order (as shown by the function frequency analysis), the detailed execution path within those functions varies significantly. The most important differences are:

    The math operations in tfp_format, which are much more complex in Test 2
    The reordering in derive_key, which suggests different processing of the passphrase values

The issue with Test 2 failing to decrypt is likely because the longer passphrase is being processed differently than expected. The "BAD DECRYPT" comment in your original code suggests this is a known issue.

The binary patching approach I provided might help by forcing Test 2 to follow the same execution path as Test 1, but the real solution would be to ensure the passphrase and encrypted data formats match the expectations of the decryption algorithm.
Claude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
