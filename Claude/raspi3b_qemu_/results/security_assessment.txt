=== Security Assessment Report ===
This report analyzes potential security implications of the code differences

Key security indicators:
- ⚠️ WARNING: 4 changes detected in cryptographic functions
  This could indicate legitimate algorithm changes or potential tampering
- ✓ Minor or no changes to memory access patterns
- ✓ Minor or no changes to control flow
- ✓ Binary size difference is minimal (0 bytes)
- ⚠️ CRITICAL: decrypt_memory function was modified with 2 changes
  Direct modifications to decryption logic are high-risk indicators
  - 7 new instructions in decrypt_memory
- ⚠️ WARNING: derive_key function was modified with 2 changes
  Modifications to key derivation could affect cryptographic security

Overall security risk assessment:
✓ LOW RISK: Score 10/100
Changes appear consistent with expected test differences

Disclaimer: This is an automated assessment and cannot detect all
security issues. Manual code review is always recommended for security-critical code.
