Generated on: Wed 19 Mar 2025 02:50:57 GMT

== Summary ==
Binary size: 139724 vs 139724 bytes (diff: 0 bytes)
Functions: 1 vs 1 (diff: 0)

== Binary Differences ==
The binary files are different.
Number of byte differences: 86979

== QEMU Runtime Risk Assessment ==
QEMU runtime risk score: 41/100
⚠️ HIGH RISK: Runtime analysis indicates potentially dangerous behavior changes
Key factors that contributed to this risk assessment:
⚠️ WARNING: Instruction count difference detected in binaries that should be logically identical
⚠️ WARNING: Execution path differences detected (143 total paths) in binaries that should be logically identical

== Security Assessment ==
Key security indicators:
- ✓ Binary size difference is minimal (0 bytes)
- ✓ No change in number of crypto-related strings
- ✓ No obvious backdoor-related strings detected
- ✓ No URL or IP address patterns detected
- Entropy comparison: kernel1.img: , kernel2.img: 
  ✓ No significant entropy difference detected
- QEMU runtime analysis risk score: 41
  ⚠️ HIGH RISK: Runtime behavior shows potentially dangerous changes

...
Overall security risk assessment:
⚠️ HIGH RISK: Score 41/100
Significant indicators of security-relevant changes
Manual inspection strongly recommended
