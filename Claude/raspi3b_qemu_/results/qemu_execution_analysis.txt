=== QEMU in_asm Execution Log Analysis ===
This analysis compares instruction execution traces from QEMU logs
between kernel1.img and kernel2.img runs

Instruction count comparison:
kernel1.img: 5715 instructions executed
kernel2.img: 5691 instructions executed
Difference: -24 instructions
⚠️ WARNING: Instruction count difference detected in binaries that should be logically identical

Execution path analysis:
Unique addresses executed in kernel1.img: 3550
Unique addresses executed in kernel2.img: 3541
Novel execution paths in kernel2.img: 9 addresses
Removed execution paths from kernel1.img: 18 addresses
⚠️ WARNING: Execution path differences detected (27 total paths) in binaries that should be logically identical

Memory address pattern analysis:
⚠️ WARNING: 83 memory address constants differ between binaries

=== Memory Layout Change Analysis ===
Memory layout changes detected: 83 constants

⚠️ SECURITY IMPLICATIONS:
1. Changes in memory offsets can affect buffer boundaries and sizes
2. Different memory layout may introduce buffer overflow vulnerabilities
3. Potential format string vulnerabilities if string handling uses different offsets
4. Possible ASLR bypass if memory layout changes are predictable

RECOMMENDATION: Manual review required to ensure memory safety

QEMU execution trace risk score: 173
Updated overall security risk score: 173

=== Compiler Configuration Risk Assessment ===
For binaries that should have identical logic, runtime differences may indicate:
1. Different compiler optimization levels (-O0 vs -O2, etc.)
2. Different compiler flags affecting code generation
3. Different compiler versions or toolchains
4. Potential security implications from behavior differences
5. CRITICAL: Memory layout changes that could affect security boundaries

Risk level: HIGH
