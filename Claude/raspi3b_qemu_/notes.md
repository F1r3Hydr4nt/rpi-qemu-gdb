Looking at the diff output from your two kernel builds, I can see a clear pattern of differences. Most of the changes are related to memory addresses or offsets within the compiled code:

The main pattern is that most values in kernel1.img are 0x00000048 and the corresponding values in kernel2.img are 0x00000044 (a 4-byte difference).
There are a few other differences:

At address 0xd3c4: 0x00000050 vs 0x0000004c
At address 0xd3d8: 0x0000004c vs 0x00000048
At address 0xd3e0: 0x00000044 vs 0x00000040
At address 0x12858: 0x00000058 vs 0x00000054
At address 0x13540: 0x00000054 vs 0x00000050


And a more significant difference at the end:

At addresses 0x1354c and 0x13550, the values are completely different between the two builds.



These differences are consistent with what you'd expect from small code changes affecting memory layout and offsets. The 4-byte differences suggest that something in the second build is slightly smaller than in the first build, causing all subsequent addresses to shift.
Since your codebase appears to be working with encrypted data and GPG, these differences are probably related to either:

The different key values that are used for decryption
Different encrypted data being processed
Different code paths being taken for encryption/decryption

The comparison indicates that your build system is working properly, creating two distinct binaries with the differences you expect. You can now test both versions to see how they behave differently in your target environment.

Risk level: HIGH

I've analyzed the two code files you provided, and there are a few significant differences that explain why they produce different logic when compiled:

    Different encrypted files being included:
        First file includes: passwordpasswordpasswordpasswordpasswordpasswordpasswordpassword.gpg.h
        Second file includes: 7379ab5047b143c0b6cfe5d8d79ad240b4b4f8cced55aa26f86d1d3d370c0d4c.gpg.h
    Different session keys being used:
        First file: const char *key = "aa26542afd6f970982eedb0ca8477fd7";
        Second file: const char *key = "427c028e28eeb15464c376d7dcca6ca2";
    Different files being decrypted:
        First file decrypts: __passwordpasswordpasswordpasswordpasswordpasswordpasswordpassword_gpg
        Second file decrypts: __7379ab5047b143c0b6cfe5d8d79ad240b4b4f8cced55aa26f86d1d3d370c0d4c_gpg

The runtime analysis confirms these differences have significant impact:

    Instruction count difference: 130 fewer instructions in the second binary
    Execution path differences: 143 total different paths
    Memory address constants: 50 differences between binaries

The high risk assessment (145/100) suggests these changes have security implications. The memory layout changes could affect buffer boundaries and potentially introduce vulnerabilities.

It appears the two programs are attempting to decrypt different files with different keys, which would naturally result in different execution paths. The warnings about "binaries that should be logically identical" suggest the analysis expected these to behave the same despite the different files and keys.

Would you like me to focus on any specific aspect of these differences or help you understand the potential security implications in more detail?

The binaries should only differ in the memory of the different header file data and keys, how could I patch kernel1.img with the 2nd tests variables in memory??

To patch kernel1.img with the second test's variables in memory, you need to identify and modify the specific memory locations where the key and encrypted file data are stored. This is typically done using a binary editor or a specialized patching tool. Here's a methodical approach:

    Locate the session key in memory:
        The key "aa26542afd6f970982eedb0ca8477fd7" in kernel1.img needs to be replaced with "427c028e28eeb15464c376d7dcca6ca2" from kernel2.img
        Use a hex editor to search for the ASCII representation or its binary form
    Locate the encrypted file reference:
        Find where __passwordpasswordpasswordpasswordpasswordpasswordpasswordpassword_gpg is referenced
        Replace with a reference to __7379ab5047b143c0b6cfe5d8d79ad240b4b4f8cced55aa26f86d1d3d370c0d4c_gpg
        This may involve changing memory addresses and pointers
    Update relevant memory addresses:
        From your analysis, there are 50 memory address constants that differ
        The specific addresses (like the ones shown: 0x0001566c → 0x00015670) need to be modified
    Create a binary patch: Here's how you might create a simple binary patch:

bash

# Create a binary diff
bsdiff kernel1.img kernel2.img patch.diff

# Or use a more manual approach with hexdump to identify differences
hexdump -C kernel1.img > kernel1.hex
hexdump -C kernel2.img > kernel2.hex
diff -u kernel1.hex kernel2.hex > hex_differences.txt

# Then use a hex editor to apply the changes to kernel1.img

For a more targeted approach, you could create a custom patching script:

python

#!/usr/bin/env python3
with open('kernel1.img', 'rb') as f:
    data = bytearray(f.read())

# Replace the key
old_key = b"aa26542afd6f970982eedb0ca8477fd7"
new_key = b"427c028e28eeb15464c376d7dcca6ca2"
offset = data.find(old_key)
if offset != -1:
    data[offset:offset+len(old_key)] = new_key

# Update specific memory addresses (example)
# You'll need to identify the exact offsets where these appear
addresses = [
    (0x8128, bytes.fromhex("6c560100"), bytes.fromhex("70560100")),
    # Add more address pairs as needed
]

for addr, old_val, new_val in addresses:
    # Find and replace the value at the correct offset
    # This is simplified; you may need to adjust for endianness
    for i in range(len(data) - len(old_val)):
        if data[i:i+len(old_val)] == old_val:
            data[i:i+len(old_val)] = new_val

# Write the patched file
with open('kernel1_patched.img', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(data)

The key challenge is identifying the exact locations to patch, especially for the file references which might involve complex pointer structures. You may need to use a disassembler like Ghidra or IDA Pro to fully understand the memory structure before attempting to patch specific locations.
FH

# You'll need to identify the exact offsets where these appear
Can't you add that to the script?

You're right - I can make the script more specific by including the logic to identify the exact offsets. Here's an improved version that searches for the key and specific memory addresses throughout the binary:

python

#!/usr/bin/env python3
import struct
import re
import sys
from binascii import hexlify, unhexlify

def find_all_occurrences(data, pattern):
    """Find all occurrences of a pattern in binary data"""
    offsets = []
    offset = 0
    while True:
        offset = data.find(pattern, offset)
        if offset == -1:
            break
        offsets.append(offset)
        offset += 1
    return offsets

def patch_binary(input_file, output_file):
    with open(input_file, 'rb') as f:
        data = bytearray(f.read())
    
    changes_made = 0
    
    # 1. Replace the session key
    old_key = b"aa26542afd6f970982eedb0ca8477fd7"
    new_key = b"427c028e28eeb15464c376d7dcca6ca2"
    
    key_offsets = find_all_occurrences(data, old_key)
    for offset in key_offsets:
        data[offset:offset+len(old_key)] = new_key
        print(f"Replaced key at offset 0x{offset:08x}")
        changes_made += 1
    
    # 2. Replace the file reference variables
    # These are likely stored as addresses/pointers
    # We need to find references to __passwordpasswordpasswordpasswordpasswordpasswordpasswordpassword_gpg
    # and replace with __7379ab5047b143c0b6cfe5d8d79ad240b4b4f8cced55aa26f86d1d3d370c0d4c_gpg
    
    # Look for partial string matches since the full name might not be in one place
    old_file_pattern = b"passwordpassword"
    new_file_pattern = b"7379ab5047b143c0b6cfe5d8d79ad240b4b4f8cced55aa26f86d1d3d370c0d4c"
    
    # This is tricky because we need to find references to the variable, not just the string
    # Typically, you'd look for specific machine code patterns that load these addresses
    
    # 3. Patch specific address constants identified in the analysis
    # Convert from little-endian representation as they appear in the binary
    address_pairs = [
        (unhexlify("6c560100"), unhexlify("70560100")),  # 0x0001566c -> 0x00015670
        # Add more pairs from your analysis
    ]
    
    for old_addr, new_addr in address_pairs:
        addr_offsets = find_all_occurrences(data, old_addr)
        for offset in addr_offsets:
            # Verify this is actually an address constant by checking context
            # (This is a simplified approach; real-world would need more validation)
            data[offset:offset+len(old_addr)] = new_addr
            print(f"Replaced address at offset 0x{offset:08x}: {hexlify(old_addr)} -> {hexlify(new_addr)}")
            changes_made += 1
    
    # 4. Handle the decrypt_memory function call which might contain direct binary offsets

    # This requires knowledge of the target architecture (ARM in this case)

This script still has limitations:

    It doesn't handle the more complex task of finding and updating the exact reference to the encrypted file data in the decrypt_memory function call, which would require ARM assembly pattern matching
    It only includes one address pair from your example, but you mentioned there are 50 different memory addresses

To make this script fully complete, you would need to:

    Disassemble both binaries and identify all call patterns and memory addresses that differ
    Add all 50 address pairs to the script
    Add specific ARM instruction pattern matching to identify function calls with different parameters
    Possibly include validation to ensure you're not changing unrelated data that happens to match the patterns

For a truly comprehensive solution, you might need to use a more specialized binary analysis framework like Capstone (for disassembly) or even develop a QEMU-based solution that can patch memory on load.

Would you like me to expand the script further to include more specific binary patching techniques?
FH

or even develop a QEMU-based solution that can patch memory on load that might work help with this?

I want to be able to patch the key and the data before the decryption proceeds

A QEMU-based solution for patching the memory on load would indeed be very effective for your needs. This approach allows you to intervene at runtime before the decryption happens, without having to create a static binary patch.

Here's how you could implement a QEMU-based memory patching solution:

For this to work effectively, you'll need to:

    Run QEMU with the QMP (QEMU Machine Protocol) interface enabled:

qemu-system-arm -M versatilepb -kernel kernel1.img -serial stdio -qmp unix:/tmp/qemu-monitor.sock,server,nowait

Determine the precise memory addresses where:

    The key string is stored
    The file reference pointer is loaded before calling decrypt_memory
    The decrypt_memory function is called (for setting the breakpoint)

You might need to use QEMU's debugging features to find these addresses:

    (qemu) info registers  # Check current CPU state
    (qemu) x/10i $pc       # Display 10 instructions from program counter
    (qemu) find 0 0x20000 "aa26542afd6f970982eedb0ca8477fd7"  # Search for key

The advantage of this QEMU-based approach is that it's dynamic - it can adapt to memory layout changes and doesn't require you to create a static patch for each binary version. It intervenes at exactly the right moment before decryption occurs.

Would you like me to expand on any specific part of this approach or provide more details on how to determine the exact memory addresses to patch?
FH

Can we also patch the data ?

Yes, we can definitely patch the actual encrypted data in memory as well. This would allow you to replace the entire encrypted file content before decryption takes place. Here's how we can extend the QEMU-based solution to patch both the key and the encrypted data:

This extended script adds several important capabilities:

    Find and patch the encrypted data:
        It can either replace the pointer to the encrypted data
        Or copy the actual data content from one location to another
    Automated pattern searching:
        Added a find_memory_pattern function to locate key patterns in memory
        Uses QEMU's pmemsave to efficiently search large memory regions
    Handling both pointer and content patching:
        Can patch either the pointer to the encrypted data (faster)
        Or the actual data content (more thorough)

To use this effectively:

    You'll need to determine the correct addresses through disassembly or debugging:
        The address of the decrypt_memory call
        Where the encrypted data pointer is stored/loaded
        Where the length parameter is stored
    You might want to have both binaries loaded in memory at the same time:
        Run kernel1.img in QEMU
        Load kernel2.img in memory somehow (could be through a loadable module or other means)
        Or extract the encrypted data from kernel2.img and add a file loading method
    For a more reliable approach, you could:
        Extract both encrypted data blocks from their binaries
        Create a mapping file specifying exact addresses
        Load this information into the patching script

This memory patching approach is much more flexible than a static binary patch since it works at runtime and can adapt to different memory layouts.
