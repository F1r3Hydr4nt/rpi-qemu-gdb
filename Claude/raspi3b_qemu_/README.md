 OBJD-T: 0b80a0e1a8009fe50510a0e1a4609fe500008fe006608fe0100c00ebEditI'll explain the key differences between these two assembly logs. These logs show changes in the object code (OBJD-T) at various memory addresses for different functions.
Here's a breakdown of the major changes:

Function: main

The two separate blocks at 0x00013844 and 0x00013788 in kernel1 have been combined into a single block at 0x00013780 in kernel2.
Original code: 64409fe504408fe0cdffffea and 0400a0e1b0edffeb
New code: 10419fe504408fe00400a0e1b0edffeb
This appears to be a code consolidation or optimization.


Function: main (second instance)

Similarly, two separate blocks at 0x00013860 and 0x000137f4 in kernel1 have been combined into a single block at 0x000137ec in kernel2.
Original code: 50209fe550309fe5e1ffffea and 022097e70500a0e1031097e7
New code: ac209fe5ac309fe5022097e70500a0e1031097e7
The registers and addresses being used have changed (from 50/50 to ac/ac).


Function: tfp_format

In kernel1, there was a single block at 0x000120f8 with code: 0e20a0e1a1ffffea
In kernel2, this has been expanded to three separate blocks at:

0x00011f6c: 0a10a0e3910303e01ef332e7090052e3fbffff8a
0x00011f80: 000053e35d00000a
0x00011fac: (longer code block) starting with 1ef13ce70130a0e1...


This suggests a significant expansion or rewrite of the tfp_format function, possibly adding new functionality.


Function: derive_key

The block at 0x0000f0a0 with code 050057e10030a0e30140a0e30300009a has been moved.
In kernel1, it appears before the SHA1Update function (at 0x00013534).
In kernel2, it appears later in the file (after address 0x00013534), but with the same code.
This is just a reordering of the assembly listing, not a functional change.



These changes indicate:

Code consolidation in the main function
Significant expansion of the tfp_format function
Reordering of some assembly blocks

The most substantial change appears to be in the tfp_format function, which has been significantly expanded in kernel2, possibly to add new formatting capabilities or fix bugs in the implementation.RetryFHCould you go through the diffs one by one and not do only the major ones?EditI'll go through each diff section one by one:

In kernel1, there were two separate code blocks in the main function:

At address 0x00013844 with code 64409fe504408fe0cdffffea
At address 0x00013788 with code 0400a0e1b0edffeb

In kernel2, these have been combined into a single code block:

At address 0x00013780 with code 10419fe504408fe00400a0e1b0edffeb

The address has changed (0x00013780 is slightly earlier than 0x00013788), and the first part of the instruction has changed from 64409fe5 to 10419fe5, which likely indicates a different memory address being referenced.

In kernel1, there was a simple code block in the tfp_format function:

At address 0x000120f8 with code 0e20a0e1a1ffffea

In kernel2, this has been replaced with two code blocks:

At address 0x00011f6c with code 0a10a0e3910303e01ef332e7090052e3fbffff8a
At address 0x00011f80 with code 000053e35d00000a

This appears to be a more complex implementation, possibly adding new logic or error handling.

In kernel2, an additional code block has been added to the tfp_format function:

At address 0x00011fac with a long sequence of code spread across two OBJD-T lines

This is a substantial addition to the function, likely implementing new formatting functionality or improving existing capabilities.

At address 0x0000f0a0 with code 050057e10030a0e30140a0e30300009a

In kernel2, the code block for derive_key that was previously removed appears here:

At address 0x0000f0a0 with the same code 050057e10030a0e30140a0e30300009a

This indicates that the code block wasn't actually deleted, but rather the order of assembly listing has changed. The function itself remains at the same memory address (0x0000f0a0).
In summary, these diffs show:

Two instances of code consolidation in the main function
A significant expansion of the tfp_format function with additional logic
A reordering of assembly listings for the derive_key function (but no actual change to the code)

The most substantial changes are in the tfp_format function, which has been significantly enhanced in kernel2.RetryFHHere is the main program which produces them based on testNumber:void main()

}Do you think there is any malicious compilation afoot or are the diffs accounted for the two test cases?EditLooking at the code and the assembly diffs, I don't see evidence of malicious compilation. The differences appear to be consistent with normal compiler optimizations for the two different test cases.
Let me explain why:

The main function has two different code paths based on testNumber:

For testNumber==1: Using "password" as passphrase and decrypting encrypted_1k_gpg
For testNumber==2: Using a long hex string as passphrase and decrypting __7379ab5047b143c0b6cfe5d8d79ad240b4b4f8cced55aa26f86d1d3d370c0d4c_gpg


The diffs we observed in the assembly code align with these differences:

The changes in the main function code blocks (first two diffs) show consolidation and different memory addresses being referenced, which is consistent with the compiler handling the two different test branches.


The most substantial changes were in the tfp_format function:

This makes sense because printf is used in both test cases, but the formatting needs are different:

For test case 2, there's a much longer passphrase to process
The second test case might trigger more complex error handling in decryption, requiring more printf capability




The derive_key function wasn't actually changed - just its position in the assembly listing was reordered. This is common during compilation and doesn't indicate anything suspicious.

These differences seem to be normal compiler optimizations for:

Different control flow paths
Different string constants
Different error handling needs

The code clearly states that test case 2 is expected to result in a "BAD DECRYPT" (as noted in the comment), which explains why the compiler might generate different code paths to handle the expected failure condition.
There's no evidence in these diffs of unexpected code insertion, hidden functions, or other signs that would suggest malicious compilation. The changes appear to be normal variations from compiling different test cases.
